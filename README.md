# Gradient-boosting-regression
Gradient Boosting Regression is an advanced ensemble learning technique that sequentially improves predictive accuracy by iteratively training regression trees to correct errors made by previous models in the ensemble. This method is highly useful for predicting complex relationships and capturing nonlinear patterns in data. By combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model, Gradient Boosting Regression effectively reduces both bias and variance, leading to more reliable predictions. It provides valuable insights into feature importance, helping in feature selection and understanding the impact of different variables on predictions. Its versatility allows it to be applied to various regression tasks, making it a preferred choice in domains where achieving high predictive performance and interpretability are paramount.
